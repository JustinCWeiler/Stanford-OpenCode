# JustinBot

My friend Justin, an esteemed member of the Stanford Class of 2024 community, often imparts valuable math lessons in our discord group chat.
Sadly, Justin is only active on discord for 12 or so hours of the day, and during the other 12, we are lost without his wisdom. This bot
remidiates this issue by immitating the wisdom of Justin during the hours in which he is absent from discord.

## Usage

Figure it out via trial and error (or by peeking at the code-- it's really short). As a hint: show some excitment!
